# CARDIO BUDDY

**CARDIO BUDDY** is a machine learning-based software application designed to predict individuals prone to Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) based on their laboratory reports. The application features a user-friendly interface and employs well-known and trusted machine learning models, including Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, to deliver accurate predictions.

---

## Project Description

CARDIO BUDDY utilizes machine learning classifiers to assess laboratory report data and predict the likelihood of an individual developing cardiovascular disease. By leveraging established machine learning algorithms, the software provides reliable predictions that can be crucial for early diagnosis and preventive healthcare measures.

## Features

- **Individual Predictions**: Enter personal laboratory report data to receive predictions about CVD risk.
- **Batch Predictions**: Upload a dataset to evaluate multiple individuals at once and obtain the Patient IDs of those at risk.
- **Output Analysis**: Predictions are saved in an Excel file for further analysis and record-keeping.

## Machine Learning Models Used

This application implements the following machine learning models for CVD prediction:
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Random Forest**
